excerpt: Kullback-Leibler Divergence.
---

<p>
The really interesting thing is the difference between the entropy and
the cross-entropy. That difference is how much longer our messages are
because we used a code optimized for a different distribution. If the
distributions are the same, this difference will be zero. As the
difference grows, it will get bigger.
</p>

<p>
We call this difference the Kullback–Leibler divergence, or just the
KL divergence. The KL divergence of \(p\) with respect to \(q\),
\(D_{q}(p)\), is defined as
</p>

\begin{equation}
D_{q}(p) = H_{q}(p) - H(p).
\end{equation}

<p>
The really neat thing about KL divergence is that it’s like a distance
between two distributions. It measures how different they are! (If you
take that idea seriously, you end up with information geometry.)
</p>

<p>
Cross-Entropy and KL divergence are incredibly useful in machine
learning. Often, we want one distribution to be close to another. For
example, we might want a predicted distribution to be close to the
ground truth. KL divergence gives us a natural way to do this, and so
it shows up everywhere.
