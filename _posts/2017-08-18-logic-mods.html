All of modern mathematics can be grounded without making any
conceptual assumptions except for the inclusion relation (a.k.a. the
epsilon relation or \(\epsilon\)–Relation) in axiomatic set
theory. To this concept are add nine axioms which allow to build up
the machinery for the advanced mathematics that theoretical physics
uses. To formulate these axioms propositional and predicate logic
provide the symbolic language we use. The nine axioms can be
abbreviated as <b><b>EE PURP
IC F</b></b>:
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Basic Existence Axioms</b></b>
</p>

<p>
<b><b>E1: The Axiom on \(\epsilon-Relation \)</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\forall x \forall y (x\in y) \veebar \neg (x\in y)\)
</p>

<p>
\(x\in y\) is a proposition if and only if \(x\) and \(y\) are both sets.
</p>


<p>
<b><b>E2: Axiom of Existence of an Empty Set</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\exists x \forall y: y\notin x\)
</p>

<p>
There exists a set \(x\) such that for all \(y\) it is true that \(y\) is not an
element of \(x\). That is, there exists an empty set, a set that contains
no elements.
</p>


<p>
<b><b>Construction Axioms</b></b>
</p>

<p>
<b><b>P1: Axiom on Pair Sets</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\forall x \forall y \exists m \forall u (u\in m\leftrightarrow u=x,  u=y)\)
</p>

<p>
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be sets. Then there exists a set that contains as its
elements precisely the sets \(x\) and \(y\). Or: For all \(x\) and for all \(y\),
there exists a set \(m\), such that for all \(u\), \(u\) is an element of \(m\) if and
only if \(u\) is \(x\) or \(u\) is \(y\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>U: Axiom on Union Sets</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Let \(x\) be a set. Then there exists a set \(u\) whose elements are precisely
the elements of the elements of \(x\).
</p>

<p>
\(\forall x \exists y \forall c (c\in y \leftrightarrow\exists z (c\in z \wedge z\in x))\)
</p>

<p>
<b><b>R: Axiom of Replacement</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\exists x\forall y \in a(\exists z  A(y, z)\rightarrow\exists z\in x A(y, z) )\)
</p>

<p>
Let \(R\) be a functional relation. Let \(m\) be a set. Then the image of \(m\)
under the functional relation \(R\) is again a set.
</p>


<p>
<b><b>P2: Axiom on Existence of Power Sets</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\forall \exists p \forall y (y\in p\leftrightarrow\forall z  (z\in y\rightarrow z\in x))\)
</p>

<p>
Let \(m\) be a set. There exists a set denoted \(\mathbf{P}(m)\) whose elements are
precisely the subsets of \(m\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Further Existence/Construction Axioms</b></b>
</p>

<p>
<b><b>I: Axiom of Infinity</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\exists m (\emptyset\in m \wedge \forall x\in m((x\cup {x}\in m)))\)
</p>

<p>
There exists a set that contains the empty set and with every of its
elements \(y\) it also contains the set with the element \(y\) (or \({y}\)) as an
element.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>C: Axiom of Choice</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(\forall X((\forall x\in X\forall y\in X(x=y\leftrightarrow x\cap y\ne\emptyset))\rightarrow\exists z(\forall x\in X\exists ! y y\in x\cap z))\)
</p>

<p>
if you have a collection \(X\) of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets, then
you get a set \(z\) which contains one element from each set in the
collection. [Schuller, using different formulae: Let \(x\) be a set whose
elements are non-empty and mutually disjoint, then there exists a set
\(y\) which contains exactly one element of each element of \(x\).]
</p>


<p>
<b><b>Non-Existence Axiom</b></b>
</p>


<p>
<b><b>F: Axiom of Foundation</b></b>
</p>

<p>
\(x\neq\emptyset\rightarrow\exists y(y\in x\wedge y\cap x=\emptyset)\)
</p>

<p>
Every nonempty set is disjunct from one of its elements. [Schuller:
Every non-empty set \(x\) contains an element \(y\) that has none of its
elements in common with \(x\).]
</p>


<p>
Differential geometry works with space, and space is made of sets
of points. So to study these things, we first will need to look at
what sets are. But set theory itself cannot be the absolute foundation.
 Try to define a set, for example as a
collection of elements, we would need some other concepts
(which presumably we cannot assume at this foundational level); for
example, how do we define a “collection” and an “element”? The way we
will get around this is by constructing set theory on the basis of
axioms rather than on such definitions. But in order to formulate
these axioms, we first need a language, in this case, of propositional
and predicate logic.  [Note, while it may seem that Schuller will
define the terms or concepts in propositional and predicate logic, he
in fact uses a logical operator, the biconditional, which is
understood merely in terms of its truth functionality, and what is
being biconditionally combined are most basically just mechanically
operable symbols.]
</p>

<p>
What could the first definition be? For a definition you need notions
that you already have in order to define a new notion. But if you do
not have any notion yet, how would you start? The trick is to start
axiomatically, and so we will have to write out axiomatic set
theory. But that then raises the question, in what language would you
possibly do that? So, actually before we come to set theory, we need
another building block down here, and that would be logic. And we will
deal with propositional and predicate logic first. That will define
our language. Then we will be able to write down the axioms of set
theory. (quoting Schuller, 0.08.30 - 0.09.15)

<b><b>Relations over a set</b></b>
</p>

<p>
If \(X = Y\) then we simply say that the binary relation is over \(X\), or
that is an <code>endorelation</code> over \(X\). In CS, such a relation is called a
homogeneous (binary) relation. Some types of <code>endorelations</code> are
widely studied in graph theory, where they are known simple as
directed graphs permitting loops.
</p>

<p>
The set of binary relations \(\mathbf{\mbox{Rel}}(X)\) on a set \(X\) is
the set \(2^{X\times X}\) which is a Boolean algebra augmented with the
<code>inovlution</code> of mapping of a relation to its <code>inverse</code> relation.
</p>

<p>
Some important properties that a binary relation \(R\) over as set \(X\)
may have are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>reflexive</code>: \(\forall x\in X\) it holds that \(xRx\). For example
"greater than or equal to" (\(\ge\)) is a reflexive relation but
"greater than" (&gt;) is not.</li>

<li><code>irreflexive</code> (or <code>strict</code>): \(\forall x\in X\) it holds that <code>not</code>
\(xRx\). For example, \(>\) is an irreflexive relation, but \(\ge\) is
not.</li>

<li><code>coreflexive relation</code>: \(\forall x\wedge y\in X\) it holds that if
\(xRy\) then \(x=y\). An example of a <code>coreflexive</code> relation is the
relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself
and there are no other relations. The equality relation is the only
example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any
coreflexive relation is a subset of teh identity relation.</li>

<li><code>symmetric</code>: \(\forall x\wedge y\in X\) it holds that if \(xRy\) then
\(yRx\). "Is a blood relative of" is a symmetric relation, because \(x\)
is a blood relative of \(y\leftrightarrow y\) if a blood relative of
\(x\)</li>

<li><code>antisymmetric</code>: \(\forall x\wedge y\in X\), if \(xRy\) and \(yRx\) then
\(x=y\). For example, \(\ge\) is <code>anti-symmetric</code>; so is \(>\), but
vacuously (the condition in the definition is always false).</li>

<li><code>asymmetric</code>: \(\forall x\wedge y\in X\), if \(xRy\) then <code>not</code> \(yRx\). A
relation is <code>asymmetic</code> if and only if it is <code>both anti-symmetric
  and irreflexive</code>. For example, \(>\) is asymmetic, but \(\ge\) is not.</li>

<li><code>transitive</code>: \(\forall x, y\wedge z\in X\) it holds taht if \(xRy\) and
\(yRz\) then \(xRz\). For example, "is ancestor of" is transitive, while
"is parent of" is not. A transitive relation is irreflexive
\(\leftrightarrow\) it is asymmetric.</li>

<li><code>total</code>: \(\forall x\wedge y\in X\) it holds that \(xRy\) or \(yRz\) (or
both) then \(xRz\). This definition of <code>total</code> is different from <code>left
  total</code> in the previous section. For example, \(\ge\) is a total
relation.</li>

<li><code>trichotomous</code>: \(\forall (x\wedge y)\in X\) exactly one of \(xRy\),
\(yRx\) or \(x=y\) holds. For example, \(>\) is a trichotomous relation,
while the relation "divides" on natural numbers is not.</li>

<li><code>Right Euclidean</code>: \(\forall (x, y\wedge z)\in X\) it holds that if
\(yRx\) and \(zRx\). then \(yRz\)</li>

<li><code>Left Euclidean</code>: \(\forall x, y\wedge z\in X\) it holds that if \(yRx\)
and \(zRx\), then \(yRz\).</li>

<li><code>Euclidean</code>: A Euclidean relation is both left and right
Euclidean. Equality is a Euclidean relation because if \(x=y\wedge
  x=z\), then \(y=z\).</li>

<li><code>serial</code>: \(\forall x\in X\exists y: xRy\), "Is greater than" is a
serial relation on the integers. But it is not a serial relation on
the positive integers, because there is no \(y\) in the positive
integers such that 1&gt;y. However, "is less than" is a serial relation
on the positive integers, the rational numbers and the real
numbers. Every reflexive relation is serial: for a given \(x\), choose
\(y=x\). A serial relation can be equivalently characterized as every
element having a non-empty successor neighborhood (see the previous
section for the definition of this notion). Similarly an inverse
serial relation is a relation in which every element has non-empty
predecessor neighborhood.</li>

<li><code>set-like (or local)</code>: \(\forall x\in X\), the class of all \(y\) such
that \(yRx\) is a set. (This makes sense only if relations on proper
classes are allowed.) The usual ordering \(<\) on the class of ordinal
numbers is set-like, while its inverse \(>\) is not.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an
<code>equivalence relation</code>. A relation that is symmetric, transitive, and
serial is also reflexive. A relation that is only symmetric and
transitive (without necessarily being reflexive) is called a <code>partial
equivalence relation</code>.
</p>

<p>
A relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive is called
a <code>partial order</code>. A partial order that is total is called a <code>total
order</code>, simple order, linear order, or a chain.[25] A linear order
where every nonempty subset has a <code>least element</code> is called a
<code>well-order</code>.

<b><b>Operations on Binary Relations</b></b>
</p>

<p>
If \(R, S\) are binary relations over \(X and Y\), then each of the
following is a binary relation over \(X\) and \(Y\):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Union</code>: \(R\cup S\subseteq X × Y\), defined as</li>
</ul>
<p>
\(R\cup S = (x, y) | (x, y)\in R\; or (x, y)\in S\).
For example, $ &ge; $ is the union of $ &gt; $ and $ = $.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Intersection</code>: \(R\cap S\subseteq X × Y\), defined as
\(R\cap S = (x, y) | (x, y)\in R\) and \((x, y)\in S \).</li>
</ul>
<p>
If \(R\) is a binary relation over \(X\) and \(Y\), and \(S\) is a binary
relation over \(Y\) and \(Z\), then the following is a binary relation
over \(X\) and \(Z\):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Composition</code>: \(S\circ R\), also denoted \(R\circ S\) (or \(R\circ S\)),</li>
</ul>
<p>
defined as \(S\circ R = (x, z)|\exists y\in Y\), such that
\((x, y)\in R\wedge (y, z)\in S\). The order of \(R\) and \(S\) in the
notation \(S\circ R\), used here agrees with the standard notational
order for composition of functions. For example, the composition "is
mother of" \(\circ\) "is parent of" yields "is maternal grandparent of",
while the composition "is parent of" \(\circ\) "is mother of" yields "is
grandmother of".  A relation \(R\) on sets \(X\) and \(Y\) is said to be
contained in a relation \(S\) on \(X\) and \(Y\) if \(R\) is a subset of \(S\),
that is, if \(xRy\) always implies \(xSy\). In this case, if \(R\) and \(S\)
disagree, \(R\) is also said to be smaller than \(S\). For example, \(>\) is
contained in \(\ge\).
</p>

<p>
If \(R\) is a binary relation over \(X\) and \(Y\), then the following is a binary
relation over \(Y\) and \(X\):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Inverse or converse</code>: \(R^{-1}\), defined as</li>
</ul>
<p>
\(R^{-1} = (y, x) | (x, y)\in R\). A binary relation over a set is equal
to its inverse if and only if it is symmetric. See also duality
(order theory). For example, "is less than" (\(<\)) is the inverse of
"is greater than" (\(>\)).  If \(R\) is a binary relation over \(X\), then
each of the following is a binary relation over \(X\):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Reflexive closure</code>: \(R^{=}\), defined as</li>
</ul>
<p>
\(R^{=} = (x, x) | x\in X\cup R\) or the
smallest reflexive relation over \(X\) containing \(R\). This can be
proven to be equal to the intersection of all reflexive relations
containing \(R\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Reflexive reduction</code>: \(R^{\ne}\), defined as \(R^{\ne} = R\ (x, x) | x\in X\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
or the largest irreflexive relation over \(X\) contained in \(R\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Transitive closure</code>: \(R^{+}\), defined as the smallest transitive
relation over \(X\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
containing \(R\). This can be seen to be equal to the intersection of
all transitive relations containing \(R\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Reflexive transitive closure</code>: \(R^{*}\),</li>
</ul>
<p>
defined as \(R^{*} = (R^{+})^{=}\), the smallest preorder containing \(R\).
Reflexive transitive symmetric closure: \(R^{\equiv}\), defined as the smallest
equivalence relation over \(X\) containing \(R\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Complement</b></b>
</p>

<p>
If \(R\) is a binary relation over \(X\) and \(Y\), then the following too:
</p>

<p>
The complement \(S\) is defined as \(xSy\) if not \(xRy\). For example, on
real numbers, \(\le\) is the complement of \(>\).  The complement of the
inverse is the inverse of the complement.
</p>

<p>
If \(X=Y\), the complement has the following properties:
</p>

<p>
If a relation is symmetric, the complement is too.  The complement of
a reflexive relation is irreflexive and vice versa.  The complement of
a strict weak order is a total preorder and vice versa.  The
complement of the inverse has these same properties.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Restriction</b></b>
</p>

<p>
The restriction of a binary relation on a set \(X\) to a
subset \(S\) is the set of all pairs \((x, y)\) in the relation for which \(x\)
and \(y\) are in \(S\).
</p>

<p>
If a relation is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric,
asymmetric, transitive, total, trichotomous, a partial order, total
order, strict weak order, total preorder (weak order), or an
equivalence relation, its restrictions are too.
</p>

<p>
However, the transitive closure of a restriction is a subset of the
restriction of the transitive closure, i.e., in general not equal. For
example, restricting the relation "x is parent of y" to females yields
the relation "x is mother of the woman y"; its transitive closure
doesn't relate a woman with her paternal grandmother. On the other
hand, the transitive closure of "is parent of" is "is ancestor of";
its restriction to females does relate a woman with her paternal
grandmother.
</p>

<p>
Also, the various concepts of completeness (not to be confused with
being "total") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, on the
set of real numbers a property of the relation "\(\le\)" is that every
non-empty subset \(S\) of \(R\) with an upper bound in \(R\) has a least upper
bound (also called supremum) in \(R\). However, for a set of rational
numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same
property does not hold on the restriction of the relation "\(\le\)" to the
set of rational numbers.
</p>

<p>
The left-restriction (right-restriction, respectively) of a binary
relation between \(X\) and \(Y\) to a subset \(S\) of its domain (codomain) is the
set of all pairs \((x, y)\) in the relation for which \(x(y)\) is an element
of \(S\).
</p>
