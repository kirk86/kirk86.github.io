<b>How to quickly setup a linux development environment</b>
</p>

<p>
Everyone these days is using virtual machines or some sort of a server
using linux. Sine I'm also one of those people where my day to day
laptop runs <code>OS X</code>, my home computer runs <code>Arch</code> and my work computer
runs <code>Ubuntu</code> and <code>CentoOS</code>, so I decide that it would be a good idea
to automate somehow this workflow whenever I would have to create or
destroy a virtual machine for my developent environment without too
much of a hassle. Thus, for this purpose I crated an automated script
to quickly setup a developemnt environment on debian based distros
such as Ubuntu for the moment. It has been tested on <code>Ubuntu 16.04</code>
codename <code>xenial</code>.
</p>

<p>
What exactly does it do? Well, first it starts by updating your system
including the installed packages and kernel. It also installs all the
necessary tools for building software from source including but not
limited to <code>gcc, g++ and gortran</code>.
</p>

<p>
Later it sets up a minimalistic desktop environment for you to work on
based on <code>LXDE</code>, which is fast and light. Be aware that this is indeed
very minimalistic, in that it does not include a web browser or pdf
reader and many more stuff. You would have to install them by yourself
if you want that or alternatively modify the script to install the
full fledged <code>LXDE</code> if that's what you want. This should be easier and
quicker than installing additional software as you go along and feel
the need for them.
</p>

<p>
Next, it installs a vnc server for you to have access to your linux
box using remote desktop. In this case its using <code>tighervnc</code> for this
purpose which also operates <code>Xvnc</code>, meaning more secure
connections. During the installation the script creates a user
<code>tigervncuser</code> which is used as the deafult user when you vnc into
your linux box. The script also sets a password for that user. During
the installation you'll be asked to provide a password for the new
user <code>tigervncuser</code> and also a password for accessing your vnc box
when you remote desktop into it.
</p>

<p>
If you feel that you need more security then you can always tunnel
your connection prior to vnc-ing into your box.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, the script installs high performance libraries
such as <code>OpenBLAS</code> and development software from which the user can
choose to either install <code>miniconda</code> or <code>anaconda</code>. It also installs
<code>Theano</code> and <code>Torch7</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the end you'll have a <code>python</code> and <code>torch</code> developemnt environment
ready to go. I'm also trying to port the script to <code>arch</code> linux and
also add some nice additions for the terminal in general. In the end
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to also have an additional port of it for <code>OS
X</code> so that everything is consistent between my environments.
