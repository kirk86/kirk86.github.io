<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of algebra</b> pretty much states the following,
every non-zero, single-variable, polynomial of degree \(n\) has exactly
\(n\) roots even thought not all of them might be real (remember complex
roots).
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>

<p>
Given a non-constant polynomial \(p(z)\) with complex coefficients, the
polynomial \(q(z) = p(z)p(\bar{z})\) has only real
coefficients and, if \(z\) is a zero of \(q(z)\), then
either \(z\) or its conjugate is a root of \(p(z)\).

<p>
There is some positive real number \(\mathbb{R}\) such that:
