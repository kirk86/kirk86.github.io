<p>
<b>Problem solving strategies</b>
</p>

<p>
1.) Analyze the problem:
</p>

<p>
Analyze the characteristics of the inputs and the desired outputs.
</p>

<p>
2.) Define the problem using mathematical notation:
</p>

<p>
Write down the characteristics of the inputs and the desired outputs
and the relationship between them.
</p>

<p>
3.) Develop an algorithm to solve the problem:
</p>

<p>
Given the inputs the algorithm produces outputs that satisfy the
problem definition. Usually involves computing some kind of difference
or error.
</p>

<p>
4.) Measure and evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
