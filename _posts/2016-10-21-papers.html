<li>Title: <i>Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</i></li>

<li><p>
Notes:
</p>

<p>
<code>Main Idea:</code> How to ease the trainig of deeper networks by
reformulating the layers as learning functions with reference to the
layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. This way
the neworks are easier to optimize you don't have more parameters
but actually less than some counterpart network architectures, for
instance VGG. In addition there is no degradastion on accuracy, on
the contrary, you can gain accuracy from the incrased depth.
</p>

<p>
The building block of the residual learning can be discribed as
follows: We have a function
\(F(\vec{x})\leftarrow\vec{x}\rightarrow\mbox{weight
  layer}\rightarrow\mbox{relu}\rightarrow\mbox{weight
  layer}\rightarrow\oplus\leftarrow\vec{x}\;\;\mbox{this is the
  identity}\rightarrow\mbox{relu}\). Instead of hoping each few stacked
layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, they explicitly
let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the
desired underlying mapping as \(H(\vec{x})\), they let the stacked
nonlinear layers fit another mapping of \(F(\vec{x}) := H(\vec{x}) -
  \vec{x}\). The original mapping is recast into \(F(\vec{x}) + \vec{x}\)
</p>

<p>
<code>Identity Mapping by Shortcuts:</code> \(\vec{y} = F(\vec{x},
  {\mathbf{W}_{i}}) + \vec{x}\) or perform a linear projection
\(\mathbf{W}_{x}\) by the shorcut connections to match the dimensions
\(\vec{y} = F(\vec{x}, {\mathbf{W}_{i}}) + \mathbf{W}_{x}\vec{x}\)

<li>Title: <i>OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection
using Convolutional Networks</i></li>

<li><p>
Summary:
</p>

<p>
<code>Main Idea:</code> An integrated framework using convolutional networks
for classification, localizaiton and detection. They use a
multiscale and sliding window approach which can be efficiently
implemented in a convolutional network. They introduce an approach
to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. In this
approach bounding boxes are accumulated rather than suppressed in
order to increase detection confidence. They also show that
different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared
network. The main point of the paper is to show that training a
convolutional network to simultaneously classify, locate and detect
objects in images can boost the of classification, detection and
localization of all tasks. <br />
</p>

<p>
<code>Pros:</code> Using a single conv net for classification, detection and
localization. They introduce a novel method for localization and
detection by accumulating predicted bounding boxes. They suggest
that if you combine many localization predictions then detection can
be performed without trainig on background samples and that way one
can avoid possible time-consuming and complicated bootstrapping
trainig phases, which ultimately allows the network to focus solely
on positive classes for higher accuracy. How do they achieve that?
Since objects of interest sometimes vary significantly in size and
position within the image, they combine three different ideas
experessed below. Regarding the terms localization and detection in
this paper the only difference is the evaluation criterion used and
usually both involve predicting the bounding box for each object in
the image.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First idea, dating back to '90s, apply a convolutional network at
multiple locations in the image, in a sliding window fashion, and
over multiple scales. Many viewing windows may contain an
identifiable portion of the object but not the entire object,
which leads to descent classification but poor localization and
detection.</li>

<li>Second idea, train the system to not only produce a distribution
over categories for each window, but to also produce a prediction
of the localization and size of the bounding box containing the
object relative to the window.</li>

<li>Third idea, accumulate the evidence for each category at each
location and size using their own dense sliding window method.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The localization task is usually a convenient intermediate step
between classification and detection which allows to evaluate the
localization method independently of challenges specific to
detection. Another important information is that classification and
localization share the same dataset, while detection alos has
additional data where objects can be smaller. Detection data also
contains a set of images where certain objects are absent.
</p>

<p>
The filters in the feature extraction layers (1-5) are convolved
across the entire image in one pass rather than sliding a fixed-size
feature extractor over the image and then aggregating the results
from different locations.
</p>

<p>
Many bounding boxes are fused into a single very high confidence
box, while false positives disappear below the detection threshold
due their lack of bounding box coherence and confidence. This
suggests that their approach is naturally more robust to false
positives coming from the pure-classification model than traditional
non-maximum suppression, by rewarding bounding box coherence.
</p>

<p>
<code>Cons:</code> Some of the training features in Krizhevsky's model were not
explored due to time constraints. Also they do not train the
regressor on bounding boxes with less than 50% overlap with the
input field of view. <br />
</p>

<p>
<code>Methodology:</code>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Model design and trainig
</p>

<p>
Network trained on 1.2 million images with 1000 classes in total
(ImageNet). The network model uses the same fixed input size as
proposed by Krizhevsky et al. during traininig but turns to
multi-scale for classification. Each image is downsampled with
smallest dimesion 256 pixels. Then, they extract 5 random crops
and their horizontal flips of size 221x221 pixels. These are then
fed into the network as mini-batches of size 128. The weights are
randomly initialized with \((\mu, \sigma) = (0.1 \times 10^{-2})\)
and updated by SGD (stochastic gradient descent) with momentum of
0.6 and \(\el_{2}\) weight decay of \(1 \times 10^{-5}\), which is
successively decreased by a factor of 0.5 after (30, 50, 60,
70, 80) epochs. Dropout with a rate of 0.5 is used on the fully
connected layers (6th and 7th) in the classifier. Network
architecture is described in the table below.

Another way to represent the network archiecture is the following
one.
</p>

<p>
\(\mbox{Input}\rightarrow
     \left[\left[\mbox{conv}\rightarrow\mbox{max}\right]\times
     2\rightarrow\left[\mbox{conv}\right]\times
     2\rightarrow\left[\mbox{conv}\rightarrow\mbox{max}\right]\rightarrow
     \left[\mbox{fc}\rightarrow\mbox{dropout}\right]\times
     3\right]\rightarrow\mbox{Output}\).
</p>

<p>
During training they treat the above architecture as non-spatial
which means that it outputs feature maps of size 1x1 as opposed
to the inference step, which produces spatial outputs. Layers 1-5
are similar to Krizhevsky et al. using <i>relu</i> non-linearities and
max-pooling, but with the following differences:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>no contrast normalization is used</li>
<li>pooling regions are non-overlapping</li>
<li>their model has larger 1st and 2nd layer feature maps thanks
to smaller stride (2 instead of 4), due to the fact that
larger strides will benefit speed but will hurt accuracy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The 3 last layers are applied in a sliding window fashion at test
time. These fully connected layers can also be seen as 1x1
convolutions in spatial setting. The authors have also released a
feature extractor named "OverFeat" including two models. A fast
one \(\ref{tab:fast-model}\) and an accurate one
\(\ref{tab:accurate-model}\).
</p>

<p>
As we already mentioned the authors use a multi-scale approach
for the classificaiton task where they explore the entire image
space by running the network at each location and at multiple
scales using a sliding window. This particular approach allows
significantly more views for voting where the result is a spatial
map of C-dimensional vectors at each scale. For the resolution
augmentation they follow the following steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They start with the unpooled layer 5 feature map for as single
image, at a given scale.</li>

<li>Each unpooled maps undergoes a 3x3 pooling operation
(non-overlapping regions) repeated 3x3 times for (\(\Delta_{x},
        Delta_{y}\)) pixel offsets of {0,1,2}</li>

<li>This produces a set of pooled feature maps, replicated (3x3)
times for different (\(Delta_{x}, Delta_{y}\)) combinations</li>

<li>The classifier (layers 6,7,8) has s fixed input size of 5x5
and produces a C-dimensional output vector for each location
within the pooled maps. It is applied in a sliding-window
fashion to the pooled maps, yielding C-dimensional output maps
(for a given \(\Delta_{x}, \Delta_{y}\) combination).</li>

<li>The output maps for different (\(\Delta_{x}, \Delta_{y}\))
combinations are reshaped into as single 3D output map (two
spatial dimensions x C classes)</li>
</ol>

classificationUsing y-dimension from scale 2 as an example.  1.:
20 pixel unpooled layer 5 feature map.  2.: max pooling over
non-overlapping 3 pixel groups, using offsets of \(\Delta\) = {0,
1, 2} pixels (red, green, blue respectively).  3.: The resulting

classifier (layers 6,7) is applied in sliding window fashion to

reshaped into 6 pixel by C output maps.
</p>

<p>
The above operations can be viewed as shifting the classifier’s
viewing window by 1 pixel through pooling layers without
subsampling and using skip-kernels in the following layer. Or
equivalently, as applying the final pooling layer and fully
connected stack at every possible offset, and assembling the
results by interleaving the outputs. The operation is repeated
for the horizontal flipped version of each image and the final
classification is produced by:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>taking the spatial max for each class, at each scale and flip</li>

<li>averaging the resulting C-diensional vectors from different scales and flips</li>

<li>taking the top-1 or top-5 elements (depending on the
evaluation criterion) from the mean class vector</li>
</ol>

ConvNets and sliding window efficacy
</p>

<p>
put image here
</p>

<p>
Caption is Figure 5: The efficiency of ConvNets for
detection. During training, a ConvNet produces only a single
spatial output (top). But when applied at test time over a larger
image, it produces a spatial output map, e.g. 2x2 (bottom). Since
all layers are applied convolutionally, the extra computation
required for the larger image is limited to the yellow
regions. This diagram omits the feature dimension for simplicity.
</p>

<p>
For the localization task the authors replace the classifier
layers by a regression network and train it to predict object
bounding boxes at each spatial location and scale. Finally, they
combine the regression predictions together, along with the
classification results at each location.
</p>

<p>
For the generated predictions of object bounding boxes the
authors simultaneously run the classifier and teh regressor
network accross all locations and scales. Only the final
regerssion layer needs to be recomputed after computing the
classification network. The output of the final softmax layer for
a class \(c\) at each location provides a score of confidence that
an object of class \(c\) is present (though not necessarily fully
contained) in the corresponding field of view. Thus they can
assign a confidence to each bounding box. For the regression
training the network has 2 fully-connected hidden layrers of size
4096 and 1024 channels.The final output layer has 4 units which
specify the coordinates for the bounding box edges.

caption goes here Figure 6: Localization/Detection pipeline. The
raw classifier/detector outputs a class and a con- fidence for
each location (1st diagram). The resolution of these predictions
can be increased using the method described in section 3.3 (2nd
diagram). The regression then predicts the location scale of the
object with respect to each window (3rd diagram). These bounding
boxes are then merge and accumulated to a small number of objects
(4th diagram)

<p>
Figure 7: Examples of bounding boxes produced by the regression
network, before being com- bined into final predictions. The
examples shown here are at a single scale. Predictions may be
more optimal at other scales depending on the objects. Here, most
of the bounding boxes which are initially organized as a grid,
converge to a single location and scale. This indicates that the
network is very confident in the location of the object, as
opposed to being spread out randomly. The top left image shows
that it can also correctly identify multiple location if several
objects are present. The various aspect ratios of the predicted
bounding boxes shows that the network is able to cope with
various object poses.
</p>

<p>
They train the regression network using an \(\el_{2}\) loss between
the predicted and true bounding box for each example having 1000
different versions, one for each class, they compare the
prediction of the regressor net at each spatial location with the
ground-truth bounding box, shifted into the frame of reference of
the regressor’s translation offset within the convolution.
</p>

<p>
Finally they combine the predicitions via a greedy merge strategy
applied to the regression bounding boxes using the following
algorithm.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Assign to \(C_{x}\) the set of classes in the top \(k\) for each
scale \(s\in 1,\ldots,6\), found by taking the maximum detection
class outputs accross spatial locations for that scale.</li>

<li>Assign to \(B_{s}\) the set of bounding boxes predicted by the
regressor network for each class in \(C_{s}\), across all spatial
locations at scale \(s\).</li>

<li>Each unit in the 1st layer of the regression net is connected
to a 5x5 spatial neighborhood in the layer 5 maps, as well as
all 256 channels. Shifting the 5x5 neighborhood around results

Where match<sub>socre</sub> is the sum of the distance between centers of
the two bounding boxes and the inersection area of the boxes, and
box<sub>merge</sub> is the average of bounding boxes' coordinates. The final
prediction is given by the merged bounding boxes with maximum
class scores and it is computed by cummulatively adding the
detection class outputs associated with the input windows from
which each bounding box that was predicted.

Regarding the detection, it is similar to classification training
but in a spatial manner. Multiple location of an image may be
trained simultaneously. The main difference with the localization
task, is the necessity to predict a background class when no
object is present. Usually, negative examples are initially taken
at random for training. Then the most offending negative errors
are added to the training set in bootstrapping passes. Independent
bootstrapping passes render training complicated and risk
potential mismatches between the negative examples collection and
training times. The size of bootstrapping passes needs to be tuned
to make sure training does not overfit on a small set. To
circumvent all these problems, they perform negative training on the
fly, by selecting a few interesting negative examples per image
such as random ones or most offending ones. This approach is more
computationally expensive, but renders the procedure much
simpler. And since the feature extraction is initially trained
with the classification task, the detection fine-tuning is not as
long anyway.

<code>Experiments:</code> Multi-view approach proposed by the authors was
critical to obtaining good performance. Using only a single
centered crop, our regressor network achieves an error rate of
40%. By combining regressor predictions from all spatial locations
at two scales, they achieve a vastly better error rate of
31.5%. Adding a third and fourth scale further improves
performance to 30.0% error.
