*Problem solving strategies*

1.) Analyze the problem:

Analyze the characteristics of the inputs and the desired outputs.

2.) Define the problem using mathematical notation:

Write down the characteristics of the inputs and the desired outputs
and the relationship between them.

3.) Develop an algorithm to solve the problem:

Given the inputs the algorithm produces outputs that satisfy the
problem definition. Usually involves computing some kind of difference
or error.

4.) Measure and evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
