*Polya* goes into great depths of revealing the intrinsic notions of
heuristics and analogy and the role they played in solving problems of
mathematical and non mathematical nature. In this journey *Polya*
wanted to remind us that asking the right questions is even more
important than the solution itself. According to *Polya* there are 4
steps we should follow in order to solve our problems:


|------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Understanding the problem             |   |                                                       |
|------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------|
| To understand the problem                |   | What is the unknown?                                  |
| ask questions.                           |   | What are the data?                                    |
|                                          |   | What is the condition?                                |
|                                          |   | Is it possible to satisfy the condition?              |
|                                          |   | Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? |
|                                          |   | Or is it insufficient?                                |
|                                          |   | Or redundant?                                         |
|                                          |   | Or contradictory?                                     |
|                                          |   | Draw a figure                                         |
|                                          |   | Introduce suitable notation                           |
|                                          |   | Separate the various parts of the condition           |
|                                          |   | Can you write them down?                              |


|--------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Devising a plan                                     |   |                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Find the connection between the data and the unknown.  |   | Have you seen it before?                                                                                                           |
| Consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection |   | Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?                                                                    |
| cannot be found.                                       |   | /Do you know a related problem/?                                                                                                   |
| Eventually obtain a plan of the solution.              |   | Do you know a theorem that could be useful?                                                                                        |
|                                                        |   | /Look at the unknown/? And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.                                |
|                                                        |   | Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it?                                                            |
|                                                        |   | Could you use its result?                                                                                                          |
|                                                        |   | Could you use its method?                                                                                                          |
|                                                        |   | Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?                                                     |
|                                                        |   | Could you restate the problem?                                                                                                     |
|                                                        |   | Could you restate it still differently?                                                                                            |

|                                                        |   | If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem.                                                  |
|                                                        |   | Could you imagine a more accessible related  problem?                                                                              |

|                                                        |   | An analogous problem?                                                                                                              |

| Carry out the plan       |   | Carrying out the plan of the solution, check each step. |
|                          |   | Can you see clearly that the step is correct?           |
|                          |   | Can you prove that it is correct?                       |
