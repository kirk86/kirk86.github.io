*Polya* goes into great depths of revealing the intrinsic notions of
heuristics and analogy and the role they played in solving problems of
mathematical and non mathematical nature. In this journey *Polya*
wanted to remind us that asking the right questions is even more
important than the solution itself. According to *Polya* there are 4
steps we should follow in order to solve our problems:


1. Understanding the problem


|                                          |        | What is the unknown?                                  |
| To understand the problem ask questions. |        | What are the data?                                    |
|                                          |        | What is the condition?                                |
|                                          |        | Is it possible to satisfy the condition?              |
|                                          |        | Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? |
|                                          |        | Or is it insufficient?                                |
|                                          |        | Or redundant?                                         |
|                                          |        | Or contradictory?                                     |
|                                          |        | Draw a figure                                         |
|                                          |        | Introduce suitable notation                           |
|                                          |        | Separate the various parts of the condition           |
|                                          |        | Can you write them down?                              |



2. Devising a plan


| Find the connection between the data and the unknown.  |      | Have you seen it before?                                                                                                           |
| Consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection |      | Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?                                                                    |
| cannot be found.                                       |      | /Do you know a related problem/?                                                                                                   |
| Eventually obtain a plan of the solution.              |      | Do you know a theorem that could be useful?                                                                                        |
|                                                        |      | /Look at the unknown/? And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.                                |
|                                                        |      | Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it?                                                            |
|                                                        |      | Could you use its result?                                                                                                          |
|                                                        |      | Could you use its method?                                                                                                          |
|                                                        |      | Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?                                                     |
|                                                        |      | Could you restate the problem?                                                                                                     |
|                                                        |      | Could you restate it still differently?                                                                                            |
|                                                        |      | Go back to definitions.                                                                                                            |
|                                                        |      | If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem.                                                  |
|                                                        |      | Could you imagine a more accessible related  problem?                                                                              |
|                                                        |      | A more general problem?                                                                                                            |
|                                                        |      | A more special problem?                                                                                                            |
|                                                        |      | An analogous problem?                                                                                                              |
|                                                        |      | Could you solve part of the problem?                                                                                               |
|                                                        |      | Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; how far is unknown then determined, how can it vary?                       |
|                                                        |      | Could you derive something useful from the data?                                                                                   |
|                                                        |      | Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?                                                                |
|                                                        |      | Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unkown and the new data are nearere to each other? |
|                                                        |      | Did you use all the data?                                                                                                          |

3. Carrying out the plan

| Carry out the plan |      | Carrying out the plan of the solution, check each step. |
|                    |      | Can you see clearly that the step is correct?           |
|                    |      | Can you prove that it is correct?                       |


4. Looking back

| Examine the obtained solution |      | Can you check the result?                                      |
|                               |      | Can you check the argument?                                    |
|                               |      | Can you derive the result differently?                         |
|                               |      | Can you see it at a glance?                                    |
|                               |      | Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem? |
