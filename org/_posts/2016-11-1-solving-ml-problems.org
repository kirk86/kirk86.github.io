*Solving ML problems*


1. Identify the problem
2. Identify the impact of the problem
3. Identify the methodology to solve the problem


1. Defining the problem. There exist different ways to do that.

   ~Informal description~

   Describe the problem as though you were describing it to a friend or
   colleague. This can provide a great starting point for highlighting
   areas that you might need to fill. It also provides the basis for a
   one sentence description you can use to share your understanding of
   the problem.

   For example: I need a program that will tell me which tweets will get
   retweets.

  - Formalism

  Here's a good example from Tom Mitchell’s machine learning formalism.

  A computer program is said to learn from experience ~E~ with respect
  to some class of tasks ~T~ and performance measure ~P~, if its
  performance at tasks in ~T~, as measured by ~P~, improves with
  experience ~E~.

  Use the above formalism to define the T, P, and E for our problem.

  For example:

  - Task (T): Classify a tweet that has not been published as going to
    get retweets or not.

  - Experience (E): A corpus of tweets for an account where some have
    retweets and some do not.

  - Performance (P): Classification accuracy, the number of tweets
    predicted correctly out of all tweets considered as a percentage.

   ~Assumptions~

   Create a list of assumptions about the problem and it’s
   phrasing. These may be rules of thumb and domain specific information
   that you think will get you to a viable solution faster.

   It can be useful to highlight questions that can be tested against
   real data because breakthroughs and innovation occur when assumptions
   and best practice are demonstrated to be wrong in the face of real
   data. It can also be useful to highlight areas of the problem
   specification that may need to be challenged, relaxed or tightened.

   For example:

   The specific words used in the tweet matter to the model.  The
   specific user that retweets does not matter to the model.  The number
   of retweets may matter to the model.  Older tweets are less predictive
   than more recent tweets.

   ~Similar problems~

   What other problems have you seen or can you think of that are like
   the problem you are trying to solve? Other problems can inform the
   problem you are trying to solve by highlighting limitations in your
   phrasing of the problem such as time dimensions and conceptual drift
   (where the concept being modeled changes over time). Other problems
   can also point to algorithms and data transformations that could be
   adopted to spot check performance.

   For example: A related problem would be email spam discrimination that
   uses text messages as input data and needs binary classification
   decision.

2. Why does the the problem need to be solved?

   The second step is to think deeply about why you want or need the
   problem solved.

   - Motivation

     Consider your motivation for solving the problem. What need will be
     fulfilled when the problem is solved?

     For example, you may be solving the problem as a learning
     exercise. This is useful to clarify as you can decide that you don’t
     want to use the most suitable method to solve the problem, but instead
     you want to explore methods that you are not familiar with in order to
     learn new skills.

     Alternatively, you may need to solve the problem as part of a duty at
     work, ultimately to keep your job.

   - Solution Benefits

     Consider the benefits of having the problem solved. What capabilities
     does it enable?

     It is important to be clear on the benefits of the problem being
     solved to ensure that you capitalize on them. These benefits can be
     used to sell the project to colleagues and management to get buy in
     and additional time or budget resources.

     If it benefits you personally, then be clear on what those benefits
     are and how you will know when you have got them. For example, if it’s
     a tool or utility, then what will you be able to do with that utility
     that you can’t do now and why is that meaningful to you?

   - Solution Use

     Consider how the solution to the problem will be used and what type of
     lifetime you expect the solution to have. As programmers we often
     think the work is done as soon as the program is written, but really
     the project is just beginning it’s maintenance lifetime.

     The way the solution will be used will influence the nature and
     requirements of the solution you adopt.

     Consider whether you are looking to write a report to present results
     or you want to operationalize the solution. If you want to
     operationalize the solution, consider the functional and nonfunctional
     requirements you have for a solution, just like a software project.

3. How would I solve the problem?

   In this third and final step of the problem definition, explore how
   you would solve the problem manually.

   List out step-by-step what data you would collect, how you would
   prepare it and how you would design a program to solve the
   problem. This may include prototypes and experiments you would need to
   perform which are a gold mine because they will highlight questions
   and uncertainties you have about the domain that could be explored.

   This is a powerful tool. It can highlight problems that actually can
   be solved satisfactorily using a manually implemented solution. It
   also flushes out important domain knowledge that has been trapped up
   until now like where the data is actually stored, what types of
   features would be useful and many other details.

   Collect all of these details as they occur to you and update the
   previous sections of the problem definition. Especially the
   assumptions and rules of thumb.

   We have considered a manually specified solution before when
   describing complex problems in why machine learning matters.

   - Summary


     In this post we've discussed the value of being clear on the
     problem you are solving. You discovered a three step framework
     for defining your problem with practical tactics at at step:

     1. What is the problem? Describe the problem informally and
        formally and list assumptions and similar problems.

     2. Why does the problem need to be solve? List your motivation
        for solving the problem, the benefits a solution provides and
        how the solution will be used.

     3. How would I solve the problem? Describe how the problem would
        be solved manually to flush domain knowledge.
