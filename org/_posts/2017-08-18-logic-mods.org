All of modern mathematics can be grounded without making any
conceptual assumptions except for the inclusion relation (a.k.a. the
epsilon relation or \(\epsilon\)â€“Relation) in axiomatic set
theory. To this concept are add nine axioms which allow to build up
the machinery for the advanced mathematics that theoretical physics
uses. To formulate these axioms propositional and predicate logic
provide the symbolic language we use. The nine axioms can be
abbreviated as **EE PURP
IC F**:

**Basic Existence Axioms**

**E1: The Axiom on \(\epsilon-Relation \)**

\(\forall x \forall y (x\in y) \veebar \neg (x\in y)\)

\(x\in y\) is a proposition if and only if $x$ and $y$ are both sets.


**E2: Axiom of Existence of an Empty Set**

\(\exists x \forall y: y\notin x\)

There exists a set $x$ such that for all $y$ it is true that $y$ is not an
element of $x$. That is, there exists an empty set, a set that contains
no elements.


**Construction Axioms**

**P1: Axiom on Pair Sets**

\(\forall x \forall y \exists m \forall u (u\in m\leftrightarrow u=x,  u=y)\)

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. Then there exists a set that contains as its
elements precisely the sets $x$ and $y$. Or: For all $x$ and for all $y$,
there exists a set $m$, such that for all $u$, $u$ is an element of $m$ if and
only if $u$ is $x$ or $u$ is $y$.

**U: Axiom on Union Sets**

Let $x$ be a set. Then there exists a set $u$ whose elements are precisely
the elements of the elements of $x$.

\(\forall x \exists y \forall c (c\in y \leftrightarrow\exists z (c\in z \wedge z\in x))\)

**R: Axiom of Replacement**

\(\exists x\forall y \in a(\exists z  A(y, z)\rightarrow\exists z\in x A(y, z) )\)

Let $R$ be a functional relation. Let $m$ be a set. Then the image of $m$
under the functional relation $R$ is again a set.


**P2: Axiom on Existence of Power Sets**

\(\forall \exists p \forall y (y\in p\leftrightarrow\forall z  (z\in y\rightarrow z\in x))\)

 Let $m$ be a set. There exists a set denoted $\mathbf{P}(m)$ whose elements are
 precisely the subsets of $m$.

**Further Existence/Construction Axioms**

**I: Axiom of Infinity**

\(\exists m (\emptyset\in m \wedge \forall x\in m((x\cup {x}\in m)))\)

There exists a set that contains the empty set and with every of its
elements $y$ it also contains the set with the element $y$ (or ${y}$) as an
element.

**C: Axiom of Choice**

\(\forall X((\forall x\in X\forall y\in X(x=y\leftrightarrow x\cap y\ne\emptyset))\rightarrow\exists z(\forall x\in X\exists ! y y\in x\cap z))\)

if you have a collection $X$ of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets, then
you get a set $z$ which contains one element from each set in the
collection. [Schuller, using different formulae: Let $x$ be a set whose
elements are non-empty and mutually disjoint, then there exists a set
$y$ which contains exactly one element of each element of $x$.]


**Non-Existence Axiom**


**F: Axiom of Foundation**

\(x\neq\emptyset\rightarrow\exists y(y\in x\wedge y\cap x=\emptyset)\)

Every nonempty set is disjunct from one of its elements. [Schuller:
Every non-empty set $x$ contains an element $y$ that has none of its
elements in common with $x$.]
