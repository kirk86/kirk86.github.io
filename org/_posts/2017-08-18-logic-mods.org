All of modern mathematics can be grounded without making any
conceptual assumptions except for the inclusion relation (a.k.a. the
epsilon relation or \(\epsilon\)â€“Relation) in axiomatic set
theory. To this concept are add nine axioms which allow to build up
the machinery for the advanced mathematics that theoretical physics
uses. To formulate these axioms propositional and predicate logic
provide the symbolic language we use. The nine axioms can be
abbreviated as **EE PURP
IC F**:

**Basic Existence Axioms**

**E1: The Axiom on \(\epsilon-Relation \)**

\(\forall x \forall y (x\in y) \veebar \neg \(x\in y)\)

\(x\in y\) is a proposition if and only if $x$ and $y$ are both sets.


**E2: Axiom of Existence of an Empty Set**

\(\exists x \forall y: y\notin x\)

There exists a set $x$ such that for all $y$ it is true that $y$ is not an
element of $x$. That is, there exists an empty set, a set that contains
no elements.


**Construction Axioms**

**P1: Axiom on Pair Sets**

\(\foral x \forall y \exists m \forall u (u\in m\leftrightarrow u=x u=y)\)

Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. Then there exists a set that contains as its
elements precisely the sets $x$ and $y$. Or: For all $x$ and for all $y$,
there exists a set $m$, such that for all $u$, $u$ is an element of $m$ if and
only if $u$ is $x$ or $u$ is $y$.
